    "You'll continue to **predict how much it costs to rent an apartment in NYC,** using the dataset from renthop.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/test split. Use data from April & May 2016 to train. Use data from June 2016 to test.\n",
    "- [ ] Engineer at least two new features. (See below for explanation & ideas.)\n",
    "- [ ] Fit a linear regression model with at least two features.\n",
    "- [ ] Get the model's coefficients and intercept.\n",
    "- [ ] Get regression metrics RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$, for both the train and test data.\n",
    "- [ ] What's the best test MAE you can get? Share your score and features used with your cohort on Slack!\n",
