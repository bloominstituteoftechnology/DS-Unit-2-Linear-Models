    "- [ ] Watch Aaron's [video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pREaWFli-5I) (12 minutes) & [video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQgVt4hFgY) (9 minutes) to learn about the mathematics of Logistic Regression.\n",
    "- [ ] [Sign up for a Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/), if you don’t already have one. Go to our Kaggle InClass competition website. You will be given the URL in Slack. Go to the Rules page. Accept the rules of the competition.\n",
    "- [ ] Do train/validate/test split with the Tanzania Waterpumps data.\n",
    "- [ ] Begin with baselines for classification.\n",
    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for logistic regression.\n",
    "- [ ] Get your validation accuracy score.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file. Or you can use the Kaggle API to submit your predictions.)\n",

    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Clean the data. For ideas, refer to [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide),  a \"reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.\" One of the issues is [\"Zeros replace missing values.\"](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#zeros-replace-missing-values)\n",
    "- [ ] Make exploratory visualizations.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding. For example, you could try `quantity`, `basin`, `extraction_type_class`, and more. (But remember it may not work with high cardinality categoricals.)\n",
    "- [ ] Do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "- [ ] Get and plot your coefficients.\n",
    "- [ ] Try [scikit-learn pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html).\n",
