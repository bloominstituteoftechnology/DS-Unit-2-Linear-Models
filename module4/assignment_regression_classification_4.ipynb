Go to our Kaggle InClass competition website. You will be given the URL in Slack. Go to the Rules page. Accept the rules of the competition.\n"," - [ ] Do train/validate/test split with the Tanzania Waterpumps data.\n"," - [ ] Begin with baselines for classification.\n"," - [ ] Use scikit-learn for logistic regression.\n"," - [ ] Get your validation accuracy score.\n"," - [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file.

was entered\n"," - `funder` : Who funded the well\n"," - `gps_height` : Altitude of the well\n"," - `installer` : Organization that installed the well\n"," - `longitude` : GPS coordinate\n"," - `latitude` : GPS coordinate\n"," - `wpt_name` : Name of the waterpoint if there is one\n"," - `num_private` :\n"," - `basin` : Geographic water basin\n"," - `subvillage` : Geographic location\n"," - `region` : Geographic location\n"," - `region_code` : Geographic location (coded)\n"," - `district_code` : Geographic location (coded)\n"," - `lga` : Geographic location\n"," - `ward` : Geographic location\n"," - `population` : Population around the well\n"," - `public_meeting` : True/False\n"," - `recorded_by` : Group entering this row of data\n"," - `scheme_management` : Who operates the waterpoint\n"," - `scheme_name` : Who operates the waterpoint\n"," - `permit` : If the waterpoint is permitted\n"," - `construction_year` : Year the waterpoint was constructed\n"," - `extraction_type` : The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses\n"," - `extraction_type_group` : The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses\n"," - `extraction_type_class` : The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses\n"," - `management` : How the waterpoint is managed\n"," - `management_group` : How the waterpoint is managed\n"," - `payment` : What the water costs\n"," - `payment_type` : What the water costs\n"," - `water_quality` : The quality of the water\n"," - `quality_group` : The quality of the water\n"," - `quantity` : The quantity of water\n"," - `quantity_group` : The quantity of water\n"," - `source` : The source of the water\n"," - `source_type` : The source of the water\n"," - `source_class` : The source of the water\n"," - `waterpoint_type` : The kind of waterpoint\n"," - `waterpoint_type_group` : The kind of waterpoint\n","\n"," ### Labels\n","\n"," There are three possible values:\n","\n"," - `functional` : the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed\n"," - `functional needs repair` : the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs\n"," - `non functional` : the waterpoint is not operational\n","\n"," ---\n","\n"," ## Generate a
