    "\n",
    "We're going back to our other **New York City** real estate dataset. Instead of predicting apartment rents, you'll predict property sales prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not just for condos in Tribeca...\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, predict property sales prices for **One Family Dwellings** (`BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY` == `'01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS'`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Use a subset of the data where the **sale price was more than \\\\$100 thousand and less than $2 million.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The [NYC Department of Finance](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page) has a glossary of property sales terms and NYC Building Class Code Descriptions. The data comes from the [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=NYC%20calendar%20sales) portal.\n",

    "- [ ] Do train/test split. Use data from January — March 2019 to train. Use data from April 2019 to test.\n",
    "- [ ] Do one-hot encoding of categorical features.\n",
    "- [ ] Do feature selection with `SelectKBest`.\n",
    "- [ ] Do [feature scaling](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "- [ ] Fit a ridge regression model with multiple features.\n",
    "- [ ] Get mean absolute error for the test set.\n",
    "- [ ] As always, commit your notebook to your fork of the GitHub repo.\n",

    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "- [ ] Add your own stretch goal(s) !\n",
    "- [ ] Instead of `RidgeRegression`, try `LinearRegression`. Depending on how many features you select, your errors will probably blow up! 💥\n",
    "- [ ] Instead of `RidgeRegression`, try [`RidgeCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html).\n",
